            <li> Cardboard box </li>

            <li> Coins or objects that can easily slide down </li>
            <li> Optional: Markers or paint to decorate </li>

          <h2 class="sub-title">Set-up:</h2>
          <p class="text">
              Take the cardboard box and cut all sides so that you are left with an open box with four frames 
          </p>
          <p class="text">
              Cut a hole in the top frame large enough to fit the object you are using to "slide" down.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
              Cut three pieces of cardboard the width of the depth of your box frame and the length of the of the sides of the box.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
              Cut slits on the two outer sides of the box even distance apart large enough for the cardboard strips to fit through.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
              Take one of the strips of cardboard that you cut earlier and pass through one of the slits on the side of the box. Leave about one inch of the strip on the outter edge of the box so that you can bend and tape to the side. Make sure that there is a space after the strip so that the object can slide down to the next strip. Do the same with the remaining strips.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
              Lastly, cut three more strips of cardboard about one inch tall and the width of the previous strips and tape the to the edge of the each of the strips. (this will prevent the object from sliding out of the box and it travels down the cardboard slides.)
          </p>
          <h2 class="sub-title">Play: </h2>
          <p class="text">
              Show your child how to throw the coin through the top hole and watch how it slides down to the bottom of the box.
