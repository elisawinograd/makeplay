            Cut one of the bottles in half. Use the top part of the bottle as your starting point. Cut a hole at the bottom side of one of the other bottles. Make the hole large enough so that the mouth of another bottle fits inside but not too large so that it slips out. Place the top of the bottle you cut in half through the hole of the other bottle making sure it is steadily inside. Cut a hole at the bottom side of the remaining bottles and put them together as you did the first two. If the sequence does not hold together, you may add tape between the bottles. Tie a string around the top of the first bottle you cut in half. You can tape the other end of the string to the fridge or a wall. Place the bottom half of the bottle you cut at the end of the sequence to catch the falling objects.

            Take the small ball or make one out of a piece of aluminum foil. Place it the top of the sequence and let your child see how it trickles down. Enjoy throwing the ball down the sequence again and again.
