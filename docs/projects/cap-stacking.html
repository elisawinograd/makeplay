              All you need for this activity are a variety of bottle caps. I tried this with metal bottle caps and I think they work perfectly, specially since they cannot be resused and they are relatively flat.

          <p class="text">
              This game can be played alone or in a team of with more than one person. The idea is to stack the bottle caps as high as you can without letting them collapse. If you are playing with two or more people, you can take turns and have each person put one cap on top of the stack. Whoever makes the stack collapse, looses the game and must start over!
