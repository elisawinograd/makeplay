          <p class="text">
              All you need for this activity are a variety of bottle caps. For the memory game to work they need to be different colors and ideally the same size. Each cap needs to have a pair that is exactly the same. Place all the caps on a flat surface facing down. If you create a square shape with the caps (as in the image) it will be easier to play. 
          </p>
          <h2 class="sub-title">Play: </h2>
          <p class="text">
              This game can be played alone or in teams with more than one person. If you are playing in teams, each team should have one person and you should have enough caps so that each person can find one or more matching of caps. This is how you play: 
          </p>
          <ul class="activity-text">
              <li> Flip one cap and keep in place so that you can see the side with the design or color. </li>
              <li> Flip another cap and keep in place </li>
              <li> If the caps are the same color, size and have the same design, you found a match! Pick up the caps and keep them by your side. </li>
              <li> If the caps are do not match, flip them again and keep them in place. </li>
              <li> If playing with someone else, now let the other person follow steps 1 to 3. If playing alone, flip another set of caps and see if you find a match. </li>
              <li> Continue to play until you have found a match for all the caps! It is a memory game so the more you can remember, the better you'll do. </li>
