              Gather all the sticks, pencils or straws and holding them vertically with one hand, let them go on a flat surface. Make sure most of the sticks land one on top of the other but it is okay if some remained scattered on the flat surface.

              This game is ideally played by two players or more. Taking turns, each player has to pick one of the sticks as carefully as possible with out letting any of the other sticks move. If any of the sticks move while trying to pick up another stick, the person must give up his or her turn and try in the next round. The person who can gather the most sticks with out moving the rest wins! Enjoy this game at a restaurant, an airplane, a waiting room or anywhere else you find appropriate.
